# REPORT

In this report, I will document my progress and findings in a computer vision project focused on driverless vehicles. The project aimed to develop a solid understanding of computer vision by starting from the basics and gradually building knowledge in Python programming, image processing using OpenCV, fundamental machine learning concepts, deep learning, and neural networks.
I began the project by revising my knowledge of Python programming, ensuring a strong foundation in the language. This revision was crucial to successfully implementing the subsequent computer vision techniques. I then dived into the world of computer vision, starting with image processing techniques using the OpenCV library. Through practical exercises, I gained understanding of image transformations such as Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, translation, rotation, and cropping. By writing Python code, I could observe the effects of each transformation on the input images and make changes in the various parameters of each tansformation to see how it effected the process. I successfully implemented five commonly used image transformations.This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into the practical aspects of image processing.
To expand my knowledge, I delved into machine learning, focusing on linear regression and logistic regression. By studying these algorithms, I gained insights into their principles and applications in computer vision tasks. Implementing these algorithms allowed me to analyze data and make predictions based on learned patterns, broadening my understanding of machine learning in the context of computer vision.Building upon my machine learning knowledge, I explored deep learning and neural networks. I studied the fundamentals of neural networks, including neurons, activation functions, forward propagation, and backpropagation. Through Python code, I implemented and trained simple neural networks, deepening my understanding of these powerful algorithms.
One of the key components of the project was lane detection, a critical task in driverless vehicle technology. I implemented lane detection using the Canny edge detection algorithm and the Hough line transform. This implementation allowed me to detect lane markings in images or video feeds, providing crucial information for autonomous driving systems. I also researched alternative methods of lane detection beyond the Canny and Hough transforms. I explored techniques such as Gaussian Pyramid Construction and subtraction. This research allowed me to gain insights into different approaches, their strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications in real-world scenarios.
To further enhance my project, I implemented object detection using the YOLOv5 model. This state-of-the-art model allowed me to detect and classify objects, including cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights, in a video stream. By utilizing the YOLOv5 model architecture and pre-trained weights, I achieved accurate and efficient object detection in real-world scenarios. This computer vision project for driverless vehicles has provided me with a solid foundation in Python programming, image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Through hands-on implementation, I gained practical experience in image transformations, lane detection algorithms, and object detection using YOLOv5. The outcomes of this project have broadened my understanding of the practical applications of computer vision techniques in the context of autonomous vehicles.
Moving forward, I can extend this project in several ways, including: Exploring advanced lane detection algorithms, such as semantic segmentation-based methods. Investigating other object detection models, such as Faster R-CNN or SSD, and comparing their performance to YOLOv5. Enhancing the project to handle real-time video processing for a driverless vehicle application. In conclusion, this project has equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute to the exciting field of autonomous driving, opening up new possibilities for further research and advancements.
